## What is Git?

Git is used as a `version control system` also referred to as a `vcs`

`Version Control` is software that `tracks and manages changes` to files over time. It allows users to revisit earlier versions of files, compare changes between versions, undo changes, and a whole lot more

You can download and read more about `git` docs on the [Official Git Homepage](https://git-scm.com/)

### Visualizing Git

Git helps us to:

-   Track changes across multiple files
-   Compare versions of a project
-   "Time Travel" back to old versions
-   Revert to a previous version
-   Collaborate and share changes
-   Combine Changes

Git allows us to make different versions of the same project for comparison, working on a different "timeline", tha changes can be combined once approved at the end of the working tree history, or, you can go back to a previous "checkpoint" of your project and you can resume working from that specific point
